# The Gelsoft Bomb Project
A [KTANE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keep_Talking_and_Nobody_Explodes)-inspired toy bomb for use in [gelsoft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gel_ball_shooter) matches.

The core concept is to have a ruggedised case (probably a pistol or camera case like the Pelican Vault V100) that can be opened up to reveal an interactive puzzle and a timer.
If the puzzle is not solved in time, the gelbomb will make a loud beeping noise and stop the timer (sounds lame, but I'm not putting gels in this thing).
This can be incorporated into your own game modes to make things interesting.

The gelbomb It features a highly-modular design, allowing many different puzzle modules to be switched in and out during the course of a day.
